This bot is still a work in progress and likely has many bugs so beware!

## Requirements
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) (Click link to install)

### Installing Typescript

Open up Terminal in the project root and run the following to things  
1. Create .env file in the root and add your bot token and client id using a text editor
```
DISCORD_TOKEN=abcdefg

```
2. Compile the code
```
